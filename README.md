Jason Ling - "War card game" 

- The game is very simple; there aren't any cheats or hints that the player can use in this version

- I did not complete one feature, which is an animation that flips the card; instead I just 
  changed the Jlabel to a different picture everytime the card flips

- I did make additional feature to the game, where instead when the value is the same it adds one card,
  it adds 4 more cards and thus the 5 card values are compared 
- Another feature I added includes a menu button in the game menu that allows the player to reshuffle the deck
- I added a border to the cards to indicate whether the player won or lost by using red or green
- I also added a function where the player can reset and start over

- I don't currently have any bugs, or I havent encountered any bugs yet
